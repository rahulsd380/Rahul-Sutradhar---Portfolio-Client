    title: "What makes this different from hiring a typical web developer or agency?",
    description:
      "This work starts with consulting-led clarity before development begins. Instead of jumping into features, technical feasibility, system design, and long-term impact are addressed first — reducing rework and costly mistakes."
  },
  {
    title: "Do you only consult, or do you also handle development?",
    description:
      "Both. Strategy and hands-on development are combined so recommendations are proven in real implementation, not theory."
  },
  {
    title: "Who is this best suited for?",
    description:
      "Startups, SaaS teams, and growing businesses that care about scalability, system stability, and long-term technical direction."
  },
  {
    title: "Is this suitable for small projects or quick builds?",
    description:
      "If the goal is speed without planning, this may not be the right fit. The focus is on building systems that last."
  }

export const aboutFaq: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    title: "Are you a consultant or a developer?",
    description:
      "Both. Strategic decisions are informed by hands-on development experience, ensuring systems are practical, scalable, and production-ready."
  },
  {
    title: "Why don’t you focus on years of experience or tech stacks?",
    description:
      "Because outcomes matter more than resumes. Decision quality and system durability matter more than labels."
  },
  {
    title: "Do you work independently or with a team?",
    description:
      "Projects are led directly with full accountability. Additional expertise is involved only when it clearly improves outcomes."
  }
];
export const servicesFaq: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    title: "What services do you offer exactly?",
    description:
      "Custom web development, web & app development, technical SEO, and AI integration — all approached with consulting-led planning and execution."
  },
  {
    title: "How do you decide which service a project needs?",
    description:
      "Projects start with problems, not services. The solution is identified through discussion, feasibility review, and system planning."
  },
  {
    title: "Do you offer fixed packages or custom pricing?",
    description:
      "Pricing is scoped based on complexity, requirements, and long-term goals. Generic packages are avoided."
  },
  {
    title: "Can services be combined?",
    description:
      "Yes. Many projects blend development, automation, and SEO into a single cohesive system."
  }
];

export const processFaq: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    title: "What happens before development starts?",
    description:
      "Discovery, feasibility analysis, and system planning ensure the right thing is built the right way."
  },
  {
    title: "How involved will I be during the process?",
    description:
      "You’re involved at key decision points without needing to manage daily technical work."
  },
  {
    title: "Can changes be made during development?",
    description:
      "Yes, but upfront planning minimizes disruptive changes and unexpected costs."

  {
    title: "What happens after I submit the form?",
    description:
      "Your message is reviewed personally. If it’s a good fit, you’ll hear back within 1–2 business days."
  },
  {
    title: "Do you provide instant quotes?",
    description:
      "No. Accurate estimates require understanding the problem, constraints, and goals first."
  },
  {
    title: "Is there any obligation after the first conversation?",
    description:
      "No. The initial discussion is about clarity, not commitment."
  }
